# Pong
Built using SDL for the window and sprite rendering. Audio is handled by the SoLoud library with the SDL2 static backend. I'm using an OpenGl window to render the sprites which requires loading of the individual functions you want to use from the library. This task can be quite tedious so people have created tools to automate it such as [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/), which I used in this project.

This project was a good learning source. I learned a lot about using external libraries and how to setup dependancies in visual studio. I learned a little bit about everything such as rendering, sound, game loops, and more. While the game is quite straightforward, it was a good excercise in finding out the right tools for the job without a tutorial placed right in front of me.
