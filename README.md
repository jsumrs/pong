# Pong
Built using SDL for the window and sprite rendering. Audio is handled by the SoLoud library with the SDL2 static backend. I'm using an OpenGl window to render the sprites which requires loading of the individual functions you want to use from the library. This task can be quite tedious so people have created tools to automate it such as [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/), which I used in this project.
